# Sleep-Optimizer-Secondary-Board

This project uses two STM32 Microcontrollers to manually control and reset light and sound settings to provide an optimal sleeping environment. This board sends the USART signal to the main board based on button input. 

Code for the main board can be found [here](https://github.com/sharisseji/Sleep-Optimizer-Main-Board.git).

The board type we used was the STM32 NUCLEO F401RE for both microctontrollers. The microcontrollers were programmed using STM32CubeIDE.
